We have developed an experimental platform specifically designed for CAPs systems that employs deep learning to predict the collective motion dynamics of CAPs.

## Dataset
All data of CAPs motion have been uploaded to Baidu network disk 
The data is strictly for academic research purposes and must not be used for commercial activities.
